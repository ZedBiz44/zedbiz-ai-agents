### Notes
- openclaw setup --non-interactive does not support --accept-risk in 2026.5.28. Directory structure created manually matching Harry/Suzy layout. Confirmed working.
- .op.token shared from Harry. Edith uses same VPS2 service account.
- Step 13 (browser first-run) is a human step - Jack to connect at https://edith.zbiz.ca with token from /root/.openclaw-edith/token.txt
- Step 12 (model config in browser UI) is also a human step - set OpenAI provider in Settings > Models
