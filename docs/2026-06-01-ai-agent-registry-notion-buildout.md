# 2026-06-01 - AI Agent Registry Notion Buildout

## Summary

- **Date:** 2026-06-01 Mountain Time
- **Agent:** Manus
- **System:** Notion, GitHub, OpenClaw, AI Agent Registry
- **Change Type:** documentation-updated, Notion-structure-created, agent-template-created
- **Status:** done

## Why This Was Done

- Jack is turning the AI Agent Registry Main Database into the main operating database for all ZedBiz AI agents.
- Supporting databases are being used as structured lookup and relation sources instead of loose notes.
- Agent MD files need to be visible, comparable, and reusable from Notion.
- A standard `AGENTS.md` template is needed so OpenClaw agents operate consistently across roles.

## What Changed

- Created and organized support database structure inside `AI-Agent-Databases`.
- Set up relation-based document tracking for agent MD files.
- Created the `Agent-MD-Files` page for viewing current live MD files, Notion MD versions, review items, and shared templates.
- Created shared Notion document `Standard-AGENTS-MD-Template`.
- Created a Technical Documentation journal entry for the standard `AGENTS.md` template work.
- Reviewed current OpenClaw-style `AGENTS.md` patterns from live agents and Notion review pages.
- Drafted the standard OpenClaw `AGENTS.md` operating rules template with sections for:
  - Agent setup
  - Priorities
  - Startup rules
  - Decision framework
  - Memory rules
  - Skill rules
  - Tool rules
  - Execution and completion rules
  - Proactive improvement loop
  - Security rules
  - Routing rules
  - Communication standards
  - Maintenance rules
- Reworked the template from `Agents MD - Structured Summary.pdf` into a more concise version focused on durable operating constraints.
- Updated the shared Notion template version to `v2026.6.1-concise`.
- Applied final feedback revision with a concise decision framework, proactive improvement loop, startup context priority rule, and tighter execution/completion section.
- Updated the shared Notion template version to `v2026.6.1-concise-2`.
- Added authority conflict handling so Jack's direct instruction wins unless it creates security, legal, production, data-loss, client-trust, or irreversible risk.
- Added complex/repeated task Skill discovery guidance and post-task Skill creation prompt.
- Updated the shared Notion template version to `v2026.6.1-concise-3`.

## Important Correction

- Jack clarified that ZedBiz OpenClaw agents use skills as the reusable process layer.
- Reusable process logic should be handled through OpenClaw skills and the relevant `SKILL.md` files.
- The template was updated to use skill-checking rules and relevant `SKILL.md` guidance.
- The concise revision keeps reusable process details out of `AGENTS.md` and pushes specialized methods into Skills.
- The final revision keeps the file concise while restoring the highest-value behavior rules for ambiguity and proactive improvement.
- The latest revision clarifies when to search local Skills, installed plugins, and approved hubs such as ClawHub before building from scratch.

## Test Result

- **What was tested:** Notion page creation, Agent-Documents database placement, Technical Documentation journal update, GitHub repo availability, concise template rewrite, feedback revisions, and final Notion template verification.
- **Result:** Notion template update succeeded. GitHub documentation file was committed and pushed to the remote repo.
- **Evidence:** Created and updated Notion page `Standard-AGENTS-MD-Template`, updated the Technical Documentation journal record, and pushed this GitHub tracking note.

## Rollback Note

- This GitHub file is documentation-only.
- If needed, update or replace this file with a more detailed action log after agent-specific rollout work begins.
