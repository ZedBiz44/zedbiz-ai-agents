# 2026-06-07 -- VPS1 SOP System Overview Added

**Date:** 2026-06-07
**Author:** Manus
**Task:** Added system overview and hosting model comparison to the Agent-Creation-VPS1-SOP Notion page.

## What Was Done

Inserted a "System Overview" section and a three-way "Hosting Model Comparison" table at the top of the Notion page:
`https://app.notion.com/p/Agent-Creation-VPS1-SOP-f24a3e33d5818256accd0185fe925af2`

The content replaced the placeholder text "Description of this system here".

## Content Summary

### System Overview
Describes the VPS1 Docker Agent Setup:
- Each agent runs in its own isolated Docker container.
- All agents share one custom-built Docker image (lean, easy to update).
- Agent configs/data live in host volume mounts at `/opt/openclaw/agents/{name}/`.
- Docker Alpine workaround handles file permissions automatically (no manual sudo).
- Caddy reverse proxy routes each agent to its own subdomain.

### Hosting Model Comparison (Three Models)

| Model | Summary |
|---|---|
| VPS1 -- Docker Containers (Current) | Shared image, per-agent containers, volume mounts, automated permissions via Alpine workaround. |
| VPS2 -- Docker (Individual Images) | Per-agent containers with individually built images. More control, higher storage/build cost. |
| Native Gateway (Multi-Agent) | Single process hosts all agents natively. Lightest footprint, but no isolation. |

**Bottom line:** VPS1 Docker is the sweet spot for isolation, speed, and maintainability at scale.

## Correction -- 2026-06-07 (Same Day)

**Issue:** VPS2 was incorrectly described as "Docker with individual images."
**Fix:** VPS2 is a **folder-based + systemd** model (no Docker). Each agent gets:
- Install folder: `/opt/openclaw-{name}/`
- State folder: `/root/.openclaw-{name}/`
- Dedicated `systemd` service unit
- Nginx reverse proxy for per-agent branding

Updated the comparison table on the VPS1 SOP Notion page to reflect the correct VPS2 architecture.
