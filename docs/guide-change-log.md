### 2026-06-02 - Edith (VPS2): Phase 1 Install Complete

- **Agent:** Manus AI
- **Problem:** New agent Edith needed to be installed on VPS2 following the Phase 1.1 SOP.
- **Fix:** Full Phase 1 install: npm install into /opt/openclaw-edith, systemd service on port 4300, Caddy routing for edith.zbiz.ca, 1Password injection, memory/wiki setup, Codex OAuth (Path A copy from Harry).
- **Test Result:** HTTPS 200 at edith.zbiz.ca, memory dreaming confirmed (0 2 * * * America/Edmonton), wiki vault ready, Codex OAuth active (expires 2026-06-06).

### 2026-06-02 - VPS2 Phase 1.1 SOP: Curated Model List Added

- **Agent:** Manus AI
- **Problem:** Edith's model dropdown showed 100+ junk models (GPT-5.4 Pro, o1, o3, o4-mini, etc.) after Phase 1 install. Root cause: SOP template used a bare `model:` string instead of the full `agents.defaults.models` curated allowlist.
- **Fix:** Added Step 12 assertion to verify curated model list is in openclaw.json. Template now copies Harry's full `agents.defaults` block (63 models, primary: openai/gpt-5.5). Applied live fix to Edith.
- **Test Result:** Harry=63, Suzy=63, Edith=63 models. Zero diff. Dropdown identical across all three agents.

### 2026-06-02 - VPS2 Phase 1.1 SOP: Missing Steps Restored

- **Agent:** Manus AI
- **Problem:** A previous `replace_content` operation wiped most of both VPS2 Phase 1.1 SOP pages in Notion, leaving only 2 steps. Jack restored from backup but memory/wiki steps were missing.
- **Fix:** Added Step 5b (codex/discord plugin install), Step 6c (pre-seed workspace files), Step 12b (memory/wiki setup with 3 sub-steps), Step 16 (GitHub tracking note) to both agent and human SOPs. Updated Done-When checklist to reflect actual model config.
- **Test Result:** All 6 key checks passed on both Notion pages after update.

### 2026-06-02 - VPS1 Phase 1.1 SOP: Memory/Wiki Steps Added

- **Agent:** Manus AI
- **Problem:** VPS1 Phase 1.1 SOPs (both agent and human versions) were missing the memory and wiki setup steps. Same gap as VPS2 -- previous update had wiped them.
- **Fix:** Added Step 12 (agent SOP) and Step 12b (human SOP) for memory/wiki setup using `update_content` surgical insert. Method: search-and-replace insert, NOT replace_content. All existing steps preserved.
- **Test Result:** 8/8 checks on agent SOP, 10/10 on human SOP. All original steps intact.
